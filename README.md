# Procrastination: percent error :ghost:

Log in and fill out the grid to get percent error. You can also upload data from excel sheet to get your percent error.
I made this website because I was too lazy to plug data into my calculator one by one. WHile there's plenty of other websites that do 
the same thing, I thought, why not make my own?

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - related framework used
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) - static site generator
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - google authentication
* [React-excel-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-excel-renderer) - excel sheet reader

## Deployed With

* [Netlify](https://netlify.com) ![Netlify](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7892489?s=200&v=4)

## Difficulties

Divide and conquer has always been a condoned practice, and minimizing components to their exact purpose has had been the goal through 
development. However, dividing components adds difficulties in passing value and disturbs the connection between them, and many actions
require to be passed as props. Following the conventional practice definitely adds more complexity to the framework and increases the 
effort to maintain.

## Future of this website

I plan to replace react-excel-renderer with sheetjs and to divide the code even more. I also want to enable the download function, which
exports the data in .txt file.

## Read before using

For the upload to work, make sure all the variable names in your excel sheets are on the first row. The code does not work in other format.

## Try it here!!!

:point_up: When you log in, I will be able to see you through firebase, but I don't really care. (Probably never gonna check :laughing: )
